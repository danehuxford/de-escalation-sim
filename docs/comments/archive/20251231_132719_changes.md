Changes
- Made metrics updates authoritative from /api/sim/next responses, added lastTurnMetrics state, and logged metrics changes in dev.
- Added dev-only server log for returned metrics and ensured gauges re-render with data-value updates.

Why
- Prevent stale state from freezing gauge updates and provide traceability for metrics flow.
