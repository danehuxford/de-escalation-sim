Changes
- Added AI patient + coach turn generation with fallback to heuristic coaching and patient placeholder.
- Added patient role handling and distinct styling in simulation and results transcripts.
- Updated scoring config and reasons to include terse command signals and delta badges in coach content.
- Updated AI route payload/contract for scenario, transcript, metrics, and turn metrics.

Why
- Enable GPT-driven patient/coach responses while preserving deterministic scoring and fallback behavior.
- Ensure coach messages explicitly reference metric deltas and patient turns are first-class.
