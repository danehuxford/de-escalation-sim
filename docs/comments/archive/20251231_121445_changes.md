Changes
- Added validation and deterministic repair of coach payloads in the AI route using lastTurnMetrics and heuristic coach builder.
- Normalized AI responses to always include a safe category and deterministic delta badges from lastTurnMetrics.
- Hardened client coach rendering to avoid undefined fields and to always display deterministic delta badges.

Why
- Ensure coach output never shows undefined values and delta badges always reflect deterministic scoring.
