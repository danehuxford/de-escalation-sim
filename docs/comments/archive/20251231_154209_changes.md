Changes
- Replaced arc drawing with point-sampled top semicircle paths to eliminate sweep/largeArc artifacts and align red-left/green-right.
- Updated ticks and debug labels to use the same pointOnArc helper.

Why
- Ensure the arc renders as a clean top semicircle aligned with the needle angle mapping.
