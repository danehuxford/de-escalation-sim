Changes
- Rebuilt MetricGauge geometry to use a single center/radius, corrected angle mapping, and ensured the needle starts at the pivot.
- Added a dev-only alignment marker line to validate geometry.

Why
- Ensure needle alignment and angle accurately reflect metric values and keep visuals consistent across arc, ticks, and pivot.
