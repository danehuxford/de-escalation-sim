Changes
- Enforced numeric gauge values, added dev data-angle/value attributes, and kept needle transforms bound to computed angles.
- Added dev-only gauge value logging and structured coach header badges with deterministic deltas.

Why
- Ensure gauge needles move with state updates and coach headers display clear category/delta badges.
