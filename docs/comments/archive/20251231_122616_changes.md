Changes
- Added prompt hashing, AI provenance metadata, and deterministic coach repair in the AI route with dev-only logging.
- Added turn provenance columns and source constraint in schema plus source/model/prompt_hash persistence on inserts.
- Added dev-only AI debug indicator and safeguarded coach content rendering to avoid undefined fields.

Why
- Make the AI prompt path provable and persist provenance while guaranteeing deterministic deltas and robust fallbacks.
