Changes
- Unified MetricGauge value/angle computation and added a dev-only value/angle readout.
- Centralized gauge inputs in the simulation page to ensure override/live values drive both labels and needles.

Why
- Eliminate mismatch between displayed numbers and needle position during live and override updates.
