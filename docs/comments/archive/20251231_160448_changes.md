Changes
- Added client-side metric polarity normalization so green/right always means better and Overall uses normalized values.
- Renamed the Escalation gauge to Calmness when inverted and added a dev-only inversion note near coach badges.
- Added dev log showing raw vs display metric values with polarity context.

Why
- Align gauge movement and labels with user expectations without altering scoring or persistence.
