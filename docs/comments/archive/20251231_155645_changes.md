Changes
- Ensured normalized coach payload always includes non-empty detail fields and added dev logging on the server.
- Added client-side logging and persisted coach content checks, plus rendering fallbacks from stored coach_tip/coach_rewrite.

Why
- Keep coach detail sections visible after reload and trace detail loss across API, client, and DB.
