Changes
- Ensured /api/sim/next normalization always provides non-empty coach detail fields with deterministic defaults.
- Restored coach detail rendering under the badge header with dev-only presence indicator and safe fallbacks.

Why
- Guarantee coach cards show full feedback content without undefined or empty sections across AI and repaired flows.
